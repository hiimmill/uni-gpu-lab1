Laboratories module Graphic Processors in Computational Applications
Use CUDA Template sample to write a program which calculates a sum of elements in given array.

Try with the following assumptions:

1. Array size < 1024 elements

2. Threads use shared memory

3. Aray size > 1024 and multiple blocks of threads are used

4. * asure coalescing memory access

5. * asure no shared memory banks conflicts
